## Project 1: Compression and Multithreading
### Overview
This project heavily employs the functions of the `pthread` and `zstd` libraries. Specifically, the `proj1.c` file takes some input file and compresses it into a `.zst` file (i.e. an archive file) using a specified number of worker threads.


## Project 2: Matrix-Matrix Multiplication with SIMD Instructions & Cache Miss Minimization
### Overview
This project heavily employs the functions of the `pthread` and `zstd` libraries. Specifically, the `proj1.c` file takes some input file and compresses it into a `.zst` file (i.e. an archive file) using a specified number of worker threads.
