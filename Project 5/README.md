# Project 5: Video Processing using Multiple Threads and SIMD Parallelization

## Setup Instructions
Follow OpenCV setup here: https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html

Also nice to have: 
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
ffmpeg -version
```

Any .mp4 file will work. You can download one from anywhere. You can also specify the number of frames to process so that you do not have to process the entire video.
